Welcome to the repository for Bowen Zhu's personal academic website, a customized version of the [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). The original project was designed for academic websites, initiated by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) and based on the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
